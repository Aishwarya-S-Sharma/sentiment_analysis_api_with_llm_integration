# Customer Review Sentiment Analysis API

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Develop a Python API that processes customer reviews, conducts sentiment analysis using an LLM, and returns structured results.

## Key Features
- **Review Processing**: Accepts reviews in text format and from uploaded files (CSV/XLSX).
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Utilizes an LLM API to determine sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral).
- **Structured Output**: Returns results in a structured JSON format.

## Requirements
- **Software**:
  - Python 3.x
  - Flask (for API development)
  - LLM API client (e.g., Groq)
  - Pandas (for data handling)
  
- **Hardware**:
  - Server or cloud hosting for the API.
  - Internet connection for LLM API calls.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Environment Setup**: 
   - Initialize a Git repository.
   - Set up a Python virtual environment and install dependencies.

2. **API Structure**:
   - Create Flask routes for:
     - Analyzing individual reviews.
     - Batch processing uploaded files.
     - Downloading analysis results.

3. **Functionality**:
   - Process incoming requests for text and file uploads.
   - Integrate LLM API for sentiment analysis.
   - Return results in JSON format.

## Usage Instructions
- **API Endpoints**:
  - **POST /**: Analyze a single review.
  - **POST /upload**: Upload a file for batch sentiment analysis.
  - **GET /download**: Download results of the batch analysis.

- **Sample Input/Output**:
  - **Input**: Customer review text or a CSV file containing reviews.
  - **Output**: JSON containing sentiment scores and classifications.

## Conclusion
- The API provides an easy-to-use interface for integrating sentiment analysis into applications, helping businesses gain insights from customer feedback.
